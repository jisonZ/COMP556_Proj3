We added four additional tests to test our implementation of DV and LS protocol. 

- test3: tests whether triggered updates are sent for both distance vector and link state in a 4-node topology. 
- test4: tests whether changedelay events are correctly sent and handled for both distance vector and link state in a 3-node topology and whether poison reverse are triggered correctly for distance vector.
- test5: tests whether a combination of changedelay, linkdying, linkcomingup events are sent and handled correctly for both distance vector and link state in a 3-node topology. 
- test6: tests whether a combination of changedelay, linkdying, linkcomingup events are sent and handled correctly in a 11-node topology with 33 links and packet dropping probability. 

Simulator output logs of these tests are included as `test{3,4,5,6}_{dv,ls}.out` in our submission.
